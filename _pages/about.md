I am a PhD candidate at the University of California, Berkeley, where I use behavioral experiments and computational modeling to understand the key to flexible, open-ended reinforcement learning in humans and machines as part of Anne Collins's <a href="https://ccn.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Computational Cognitive Neuroscience lab</a>. I recently visited Pierre-Yves Oudeyer's <a href="https://flowers.inria.fr/" target="_blank">Flowers AI & CogSci lab</a> at Inria as a Chateaubriand STEM Fellow.
    
I am currently interning at the <a href="https://labs.amazon.science/" target="_blank">Amazon AGI Labs</a> as a Member of Technical Staff, bridging Cognitive Science and AI research. Previously, I interned at <a href="https://about.meta.com/" target="_blank">Meta</a>: in 2025, as a Research Scientist using LLMs to understand teenagers' use of social media; in 2024, as a Machine Learning SWE working to improve content recommendations for over 3 billion users. In 2023, I was part of the R&D team at <a href="https://thimus.com/en/home/" target="_blank">Thimus</a>, a world-leading company in cultural and applied neuroscience. In 2022, I was one of the <a href="https://www.novatalent.com/111/italy/student-list/2022" target="_blank">Nova</a> top 11 Italian talents under 25 in Healthcare & Bio Sciences.

Before my PhD, I  obtained a Neuroscience BSc from King's College London (2020) and a Cognitive and Decision Sciences MSc from UCL (2021), graduating at the top of my class in both. While at UCL, I worked at Tali Sharot's <a href="http://affectivebrain.com/" target="_blank">Affective Brain lab</a> and co-founded the <a href="linkedin.com/company/ucl-behavioural-innovations-society/" target="_blank">Behavioural Innovations Society</a>.

I am also the author of an Italian children's book titled <a href="https://www.amazon.it/dp/B0DL5CX7SP" target="_blank">La gara di pattinaggio</a>, which was beautifully illustrated by my brother Daniel. We are donating all proceeds from the first 100 copies to <a href="https://www.dottorsorriso.it/" target="_blank">Fondazione Dottor Sorriso</a>.
